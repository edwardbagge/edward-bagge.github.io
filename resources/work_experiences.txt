    <h4>Summer Trainee at Digital Support Team</h4>
    <p>
        During the summers of 2022 & 2023, I had the opportunity to work with the digital services
        team at Konecranes. The team's main responsibilities involve defining, supporting, and
        launching new digital service products, including customer portals (YOURKONECRANES.COM),
        customer reporting solutions, and remote monitoring products (TRUCONNECT). <br><br>

        In my first summer, my tasks primarily revolved around data maintenance, translating
        content for customer portals, creating descriptions for service products, and analyzing
        the usage of customer portals. <br><br>

        During the second summer, I was entrusted with additional tasks and given more
        responsibilities. These included crafting new content for the info-pages in the customer
        portal and effectively solving and managing various support tasks. <br><br>

        This job provided me with valuable experience in using different IT systems, both
        commercial and the company's tailor-made programs. Moreover, it allowed me to gain
        insight into how a large company operates and how different teams collaboratively
        support one another internally.

    <h4>Mathematics Tutor for High School Students</h4>
    <p>
        Since the beginning of 2022, I've been employed at Uplus, a Finnish company specializing
        in providing tutoring services for students of all ages. During my tenure, I have
        assisted more than 10 high school students, each seeking support for their matriculation
        exams. My responsibilities revolve around catering to the unique needs of each individual,
        with their preferences and learning styles guiding the sessions. <br><br>

        This job has provided me with the opportunity to be creative in how I teach the students,
        which has been very rewarding. Being a tutor can be mentally demanding due to the high
        expectations, but I have handled it with great proficiency. This is largely attributed to
        the genuine pleasure I experience witnessing the progress made by my students.

    <h4>Mathematics Teacher at Adult Education Center</h4>
    <p>
        In the spring of 2023, I served as a teacher in a mathematics sprint course at Västra
        Nylands Folkhögskola. The course was designed for high school students preparing for
        their matriculation exams. I taught two groups over the span of five weekends, each
        group consisting of approximately 15 students. <br><br>

        The job was nice, it was a completely new thing for me, since I've earlier only taught
        one student at a time.

    <h4>Customer Service at Guest Harbour</h4>
    <p>
        During the summers of 2016 - 2018 & 2020 - 2021, I had the opportunity to work at
        Ekenäs Gästhamn. As part of my role, I assisted customers in renting boat berths and
        provided additional services such as sauna facilities, laundry room access, and offering
        tourist information. It was a great experience, allowing me to showcase my strong
        customer service skills. <br><br>

        I also got the opportunity to take some shifts at the company's harbour terrace, Baywatch.
        The job included selling pizza, coffee and refreshing beverages. Additionally, I contributed
        to various tasks, such as table service, dishwashing, and supporting kitchen operations.

    <h4>Seasonal Assistant at Tire & Wheel Shop</h4>
    <p>
        During the spring seasons of 2019 and 2020, I worked at Ekenäs Däckmarket. My role
        primarily involved supporting the regular workforce during the busy weeks in spring
        when the region underwent the annual shift from winter to summer tires. My responsibilities
        encompassed tasks such as washing and balancing wheels. Additionally, I was entrusted with
        the duty of maintaining the tire warehouse in optimal logistical condition. <br><br>

        The work was physically demanding, yet immensely rewarding due to the opportunity to
        collaborate with a dedicated team. The job provided an excellent platform for learning
        valuable skills. Notably, I acquired proficiency in effective teamwork and stress
        management, aptitudes that continue to serve me well to this day.
