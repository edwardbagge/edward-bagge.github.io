                <p>
                    Hello there! I'm Edward Bagge, and I'm really happy you stumbled upon my website. I'm a 23 - year old
                    guy from Espoo, Finland. I'm a highly motivated guy who loves new challenges. Since a young age, I
                    have been adept at problem-solving and engaging in creative pursuits. <br><br>

            <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>

            <div class="textbox_left">
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love doing sports. Right now, I'm into swimming, running, and hitting the gym
                    for some light workouts. Staying active not only keeps me physically fit but also helps me stay
                    mentally balanced. <br><br>

                    Besides sports, I thoroughly enjoy working on my own programming projects and creating 3D CAD drawings.
                    These activities allow me to express myself creatively, making the world of programming and CAD works an
                    exciting realm for me.

                        <h4>Summer Trainee at Digital Support Team</h4>
                        <p>
                            During the summers of 2022 & 2023, I had the opportunity to work with the digital services
                            team at Konecranes. The team's main responsibilities involve defining, supporting, and
                            launching new digital service products, including customer portals (YOURKONECRANES.COM),
                            customer reporting solutions, and remote monitoring products (TRUCONNECT). <br><br>

                            In my first summer, my tasks primarily revolved around data maintenance, translating
                            content for customer portals, creating descriptions for service products, and analyzing
                            the usage of customer portals. <br><br>

                            During the second summer, I was entrusted with additional tasks and given more
                            responsibilities. These included crafting new content for the info-pages in the customer
                            portal and effectively solving and managing various support tasks. <br><br>

                            This job provided me with valuable experience in using different IT systems, both
                            commercial and the company's tailor-made programs. Moreover, it allowed me to gain
                            insight into how a large company operates and how different teams collaboratively
                            support one another internally.

                        <h4>Mathematics Tutor for High School Students</h4>
                        <p>
                            Since the beginning of 2022, I've been employed at Uplus, a Finnish company specializing
                            in providing tutoring services for students of all ages. During my tenure, I have
                            assisted more than 10 high school students, each seeking support for their matriculation
                            exams. My responsibilities revolve around catering to the unique needs of each individual,
                            with their preferences and learning styles guiding the sessions. <br><br>

                            This job has provided me with the opportunity to be creative in how I teach the students,
                            which has been very rewarding. Being a tutor can be mentally demanding due to the high
                            expectations, but I have handled it with great proficiency. This is largely attributed to
                            the genuine pleasure I experience witnessing the progress made by my students.

                        <h4>Mathematics Teacher at Adult Education Center</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the spring of 2023, I served as a teacher in a mathematics sprint course at Västra
                            Nylands Folkhögskola. The course was designed for high school students preparing for
                            their matriculation exams. I taught two groups over the span of five weekends, each
                            group consisting of approximately 15 students. <br><br>

                            The job was nice, it was a completely new thing for me, since I've earlier only taught
                            one student at a time.

                        <h4>Customer Service at Guest Harbour</h4>
                        <p>
                            During the summers of 2016 - 2018 & 2020 - 2021, I had the opportunity to work at
                            Ekenäs Gästhamn. As part of my role, I assisted customers in renting boat berths and
                            provided additional services such as sauna facilities, laundry room access, and offering
                            tourist information. It was a great experience, allowing me to showcase my strong
                            customer service skills. <br><br>

                            I also got the opportunity to take some shifts at the company's harbour terrace, Baywatch.
                            The job included selling pizza, coffee and refreshing beverages. Additionally, I contributed
                            to various tasks, such as table service, dishwashing, and supporting kitchen operations.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Seasonal Assistant at Tire & Wheel Shop</h4>
                        <p>
                            During the spring seasons of 2019 and 2020, I worked at Ekenäs Däckmarket. My role
                            primarily involved supporting the regular workforce during the busy weeks in spring
                            when the region underwent the annual shift from winter to summer tires. My responsibilities
                            encompassed tasks such as washing and balancing wheels. Additionally, I was entrusted with
                            the duty of maintaining the tire warehouse in optimal logistical condition. <br><br>

                            The work was physically demanding, yet immensely rewarding due to the opportunity to
                            collaborate with a dedicated team. The job provided an excellent platform for learning
                            valuable skills. Notably, I acquired proficiency in effective teamwork and stress
                            management, aptitudes that continue to serve me well to this day.
