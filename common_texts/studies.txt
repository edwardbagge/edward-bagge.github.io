I am currently studying at Aalto-University, situated in Espoo, Finland. My major is mechanical
engineering, and I have data science as my minor. As you can see, my interests align closely with
my field of study. I commenced my studies in the autumn of 2020, and I plan to write my bachelor's
thesis in the autumn of 2023. Upon completing my bachelor's degree, I intend to proceed directly to
my master's studies.
