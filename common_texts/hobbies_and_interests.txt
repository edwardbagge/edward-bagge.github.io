In my free time, I love doing sports. Right now, I'm into swimming, running, and hitting the gym
for some light workouts. Staying active not only keeps me physically fit but also helps me stay
mentally balanced. <br><br>

Besides sports, I thoroughly enjoy working on my own programming projects and creating 3D CAD drawings.
These activities allow me to express myself creatively, making the world of programming and CAD works
an exciting realm for me.
