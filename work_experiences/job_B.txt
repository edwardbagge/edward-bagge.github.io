Since the beginning of 2022, I've been employed at Uplus, a Finnish company specializing
in providing tutoring services for students of all ages. During my tenure, I have
assisted more than 10 high school students, each seeking support for their matriculation
exams. My responsibilities revolve around catering to the unique needs of each individual,
with their preferences and learning styles guiding the sessions. <br><br>

This job has provided me with the opportunity to be creative in how I teach the students,
which has been very rewarding. Being a tutor can be mentally demanding due to the high
expectations, but I have handled it with great proficiency. This is largely attributed to
the genuine pleasure I experience witnessing the progress made by my students.
