During the summers of 2016 - 2018 & 2020 - 2021, I had the opportunity to work at
Ekenäs Gästhamn. As part of my role, I assisted customers in renting boat berths and
provided additional services such as sauna facilities, laundry room access, and offering
tourist information. It was a great experience, allowing me to showcase my strong
customer service skills. <br><br>

I also got the opportunity to take some shifts at the company's harbour terrace, Baywatch.
The job included selling pizza, coffee and refreshing beverages. Additionally, I contributed
to various tasks, such as table service, dishwashing, and supporting kitchen operations.
