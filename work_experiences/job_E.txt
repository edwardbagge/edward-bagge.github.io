During the spring seasons of 2019 and 2020, I worked at Ekenäs Däckmarket. My role
primarily involved supporting the regular workforce during the busy weeks in spring
when the region underwent the annual shift from winter to summer tires. My responsibilities
encompassed tasks such as washing and balancing wheels. Additionally, I was entrusted with
the duty of maintaining the tire warehouse in optimal logistical condition. <br><br>

The work was physically demanding, yet immensely rewarding due to the opportunity to
collaborate with a dedicated team. The job provided an excellent platform for learning
valuable skills. Notably, I acquired proficiency in effective teamwork and stress
management, aptitudes that continue to serve me well to this day.
