In the spring of 2023, I served as a teacher in a mathematics sprint course at Västra
Nylands Folkhögskola. The course was designed for high school students preparing for
their matriculation exams. I taught two groups over the span of five weekends, each
group consisting of approximately 15 students. <br><br>

The job was nice, it was a completely new thing for me, since I've earlier only taught
one student at a time.
