During the summers of 2022 & 2023, I had the opportunity to work with the digital services
team at Konecranes. The team's main responsibilities involve defining, supporting, and
launching new digital service products, including customer portals (YOURKONECRANES.COM),
customer reporting solutions, and remote monitoring products (TRUCONNECT). <br><br>

In my first summer, my tasks primarily revolved around data maintenance, translating
content for customer portals, creating descriptions for service products, and analyzing
the usage of customer portals. <br><br>

During the second summer, I was entrusted with additional tasks and given more
responsibilities. These included crafting new content for the info-pages in the customer
portal and effectively solving and managing various support tasks. <br><br>

This job provided me with valuable experience in using different IT systems, both
commercial and the company's tailor-made programs. Moreover, it allowed me to gain
insight into how a large company operates and how different teams collaboratively
support one another internally.
